# Database Seeders

This directory contains seeder files to populate your database with test data.

## 📁 Files

- `user_seeder.php` - Creates test users with Vendor IDs and Client IDs
- `package_seeder.php` - Creates daily packages for Monday through Sunday using active products
- `run_seeder.php` - Runs all seeders (web interface)

## 🚀 How to Use

### Method 1: Web Browser (Easiest)
1. Visit: `http://localhost/green-grocers/database/seeders/run_seeder.php`
2. The seeder will run and show results

### Method 2: Command Line
```bash
cd C:\xampp\htdocs\green-grocers
php database/seeders/user_seeder.php
```

## 📋 What Gets Created

### User Seeder Creates:
- **Trivestore Users** (with vendorId):
  - vendor1@trivestore.com (vendor role)
  - vendor2@trivestore.com (vendor role)
  - customer1@trivestore.com (customer role)

- **Trivemart Users** (with clientId):
  - client1@trivemart.com (customer role)
  - client2@trivemart.com (customer role)

- **Admin User**:
  - admin@green-grocers.com (admin role)

- **Logistic User**:
  - logistic1@green-grocers.com (logistic role)

### Package Seeder Creates:
- 7 active packages, one for each day from Monday to Sunday
- Each package includes 4 real product names pulled from the `products` table
- Featured package cards ready for the landing page and add-to-cart flow

## 🔑 Default Passwords

All test users (except admin) use password: `password123`
Admin user uses password: `admin123`

## 🔄 Vendor ID Format

- **Trivestore users**: Get `VEND-XXXXXXXX` (8 random characters)
- **Trivemart users**: Get `MART-XXXXXXXX` (8 random characters)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Duplicate Prevention**: The seeder checks if users already exist and skips them
2. **Safe to Run Multiple Times**: Won't create duplicates
3. **Test Data Only**: Use for development/testing only
4. **Email Confirmation**: All users are pre-confirmed (isEmailConfirmed = true)

## 🧹 Reset Database

If you want to start fresh:

1. Delete existing test users:
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%@trivestore.com' 
      OR email LIKE '%@trivemart.com' 
      OR email LIKE '%@green-grocers.com';
   ```

2. Run seeder again

## 📊 Verify Results

After running the seeder, check your database:

```sql
SELECT email, platform, role, vendorId, clientId 
FROM users 
WHERE email LIKE '%@trivestore.com' 
   OR email LIKE '%@trivemart.com' 
   OR email LIKE '%@green-grocers.com';
```
